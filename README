Reason for Choosing CodeSandbox

    I have chosen CodeSandbox over Docker for the following reasons:
        1️⃣ Instant Setup – No need for local installation.
        2️⃣ Faster Development & Collaboration – Supports real-time collaboration.
        3️⃣ No System Compatibility Issues – Runs entirely in the browser.
        4️⃣ Best for Prototyping & Quick Demos – Ideal for rapid development.
        5️⃣ Built-in Environment for Frontend Apps – Pre-configured for React, Vue, and other frameworks.

Project File Structure

📂 Public Folder
    Contains the index.html file, which serves as the entry point for rendering all components.

📂 Src Folder
    Houses all main pages, components, and related files.

📂 Components Folder
    Contains reusable components and smaller UI elements.

📄 index.js
    The main file where all components are rendered.

📄 App.js
    The central file where the core application logic resides, including routing.

📄 Newspage.js
    Displays news articles with search and filter functionality.

📄 Newsfeed.js
    A single-news page where users can customize the view and navigate between articles using the "Next" button.

This structure ensures clean organization, maintainability, and efficient development within CodeSandbox. 🚀
